Deep Umbra is a a novel computational framework that enables the quantification of sunlight access and shadows at a global scale. Our framework is based on a generative adversarial network that considers the physical form of cities to compute high-resolution spatial information of accumulated sunlight access for the different seasons of the year. Deep Umbra's primary motivation is the impact that shadow management can have in people's quality of live, since it can affect levels of comfort, heat distribution, public parks, and so on.

We also present the Global Shadow Dataset, a comprehensive dataset with the accumulated shadow information for over 100 cities in 6 continents.
